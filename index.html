        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I am a listener who enjoys getting feedback on a product from the user. I enjoy communicating and having conversations, which is why I excel at the User Research aspect of UX Design and Research. I listen to the feedback that the user provides on the prodduct, and am able to disseminate that information to my team, to then continue to improve the product!</p>

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <p>I thrive when working with other people. I have learned that success only comes through collaboration! I have really enjoyed the collaborative aspect of UX Research. I find so much value in collaboration, and have been able to improve the products while bouncing ideas off of teammates or co-creators. </p>

        <h3>Iteration</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite parts of UX Research and Design is iterating the product. I enjoy gathering data and feedback, sharing it with teammates, and making the product better. I am able to organize data collected throughout user research and feedback, and can tweak the product to wireframe in order to constantly improve the product.</p>
